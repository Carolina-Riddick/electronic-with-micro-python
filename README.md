## Electronic with MicroPython course

**Electronics course with MicroPython where I will develop the use of the Raspberry Pi Pico board to set movement, sound, light (LED) and temperature using different devices**

--------- 

### *Elements will use:*


1. Raspberry Pi Pico 
   • [Raspberry Pi Foundations Products] (https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/)     
   • For more details, the full documentation of the RPico can be found at the following link: Raspberry Pi Pico Datasheet.

   • A summary of the specifications are:

     * A. RP2040 microcontroller 
     * B. 264[kB] SRAM 
     * C. 2[MB] external FLASH memory 
     * D. Micro-USB port (for power supply and to load our programs) 
     * E. 40 pinout: 
       * E.1. 26 GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins. 
       * E.2. 2 SPI pins (Serial Peripheral Interface) 
       * E.3. 2 Pins I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) 
       * E.4. 2 UART pins (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) 
       * E.5. 3 ADC 12-bit pins (Analogue-to-Digital Converter) 
       * E.6. 16 PWM pins (Pulse-Width Modulation) 
       * E.7. 8 PIO (Programmable Input/Output) Pins

2. Protoboard
3. Dupont Cable Male-Male(M2M) y Male-Female(M2F)
4. Light (LED):
5. 330[ohms] resistance:
6. Touch button Open:
7. Active piezoelectric buzzer
8. Sensor PIR HC-SR501
9. 10[kOhm] potentiometer:
10. LCD display 1602 with I2C module:
11. Temperature and humidity sensor DHT11 or DHT22:
12. MicroPython software
13. Thonny IDE Python (https://thonny.org/) 
    * Toolbar: offers quick access via icons to the most frequently used program functions such as New program, open file, save, execute the script, etc
    * Script area: where MicroPython programs are written. It is divided into the main area for code and a small side margin for displaying line numbers.
    * Shell: allows the execution of console commands and also provides information on the execution of programs.
    * Interpreter: shows and allows us to change the Python interpreter, i.e. the version of Python used to run our programs. Here we must click, and select MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico).
